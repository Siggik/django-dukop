"Money shouldn't be an issue, as you should not be dependent on having the "

"\n"
"<p>The crew behind the homepage does not upload events to the calendar, so "
"Duk Op is entirely dependent on you and your group contributing with your "

"\n"
"<p>Duk Op is a political project. We dream of a different and better world. "
"A world based on principles of freedom, equality and autonomy and without "
"discrimination and oppression in all its forms. We get excited about "
"activism, self-organisation and about initiatives and cultural projects that "
"are more than something you can write on your CV or that you can earn money "
"from. We wish to support places, groups and individuals who share these "
"values. For this reason, events that for instance have a parlamentarian goal "
"or that aim at commercial profit are not welcome on the calendar.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Generally, Duk Op aims at hosting open events. However, we do see "
"exceptions, for example in the case of separatistic events that focus on "
"gender. On the other hand, closed member-meetings and the like do not belong "
"on the calendar, but belong to the organisation or group's own communication "
"channels (e.g. mailing-list).</p>\n"
"\n"

"<h1>Duk Op and Online Security</h1>\n"
"\n"
" <p>\n"
"  Duk Op takes your internet privacy seriously, and does its best to avoid "
"gathering unnecessary information about its users. On this page you can read "
"more about our policy, about the different user types we have on the "
"website, about why you should protect yourself when surfing the internet, "
"and also find a simple way to protect your privacy when online.\n"
"  </p>\n"
"\n"
" <h2 id=\"policy\">Our policy</h2>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  The aim of our privacy policy is to protect our users from unwanted "
"surveillance of their online activities.\n"
"  User privacy is one of our foremost concerns and we have developed dukop."
"dk with this in mind.\n"
"  </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
" Like almost all websites, we log visits and activity on the website in "
"order to debug errors and identify attackers.\n"
" However, we delete all logs that are more than two days old and we do not "
"make any effort to connect IP addresses to specific users or their "
"activity.\n"
" This means that we cannot in practice connect users to IP addresses after "
"these two days, nor do we wish to.\n"
" Please note however, that if you need to conceal your IP address while on "
"Duk Op, we recommend the use of TOR, as <a href=\"#protect\">described "
"below</a>.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  For the same reason we have actively chosen not to link our Duk Op login "
"to Facebook or Google, which are companies that you cannot trust, when it "
"concerns your data and your privacy.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>We do however save the email addresses of our registered users in our "
"database. This is necessary for us to send email confirmations and to allow "
"us to reset users' passwords for them.\n"
" We may also use user's email address to contact users if there are problems "
"with the events they have created. Users' passwords are stored in an "
"encrypted format in our database (bcrypt). This means that even though we "
"control our database, we still cannot read your password; we can only "
"confirm that you have entered the correct password when you log in.</p>\n"
" <p>Duk Op is only available over a secure web connection. This means that "
"the data you exchange with the application will always be encrypted to "
"prevent interception by people eavesdropping on your connection.</p>\n"
"\n"
" <h2 id=\"users\">Duk Op's different user types</h2>\n"
" <p>\n"
" There are two different possibilities to create events here on dukop.dk. "
"Events can either be created by registered users or by anonymous users.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <h4>Registered user</h4>\n"
" <p>\n"
" To log in as a user you need to register with a username and password, and "
"need to write your email in order to get a confirmation. This allows you to "
"access more functions, like editing or deleting events you have created or "
"commenting on your and others' events with your visible username.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <h4>Anonymous user</h4>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  Alternatively, you can choose to create events anonymously. A username is "
"generated for you, and you do not need to provide a password or a valid "
"email address. The event is created by the user \"Anonymous\". Keep in mind "
"that you cannot edit or delete your event after your session expires or you "
"log out.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  Cool, right? Yes, but there are still some things you need to be aware of, "
"if you need to make sure that no one else (for instance your internet "
"provider) eavesdrops when you use dukop.dk and if you want to make use of "
"all the features on the website. Read on to find out why should protect "
"yourself on the internet, or jump directly to how you can do it.\n"
" </p>\n"
"\n"
" <h2 id=\"why\">Why should I think about internet security?</h2>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  Despite the fact that we do not register your IP address when you visit "
"dukop.dk, as a rule of thumb you cannot trust that your internet provider or "
"other actors do not keep an eye on what you do online. For this reason you "
"need to be very careful if you want to protect yourself and your private "
"life, for instance when you invite other people to participate in political "
"activities. Perhaps you are sitting there and thinking that the activities "
"you are advertising for on Duk Op are legal and innocent, and that you do "
"not need to worry about internet security. Well, you might be right, but "
"there are at least two good reasons to protect yourself when you use Duk Op "
"(and all the rest of the internet, too!).\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  The first good reason is that it is all about habits: the more we get used "
"to protect ourselves in normal and \"innocent\" situations on the internet, "
"the less we will need to change our ways of doing when we actually do need "
"to be anonymous. So it may very well be that you don't think that the "
"lecture on Swedish birds you are holding in two weeks is anything dangerous, "
"but by acting securely and by protecting you today, you get used to it, and "
"do not panic or make mistakes when you need to invite to pirate party or a "
"blockade in two months.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  The second good reason is solidarity: the more people hides their traces "
"from the internet, the less suspicious it looks, when others, that might "
"need it more than us, do it too. So, by using the intenet securely, you are "
"doing a favour to both yourself and your comrades!\n"
"  </p>\n"
"\n"
" <h2 id=\"project\">How should I protect myself when on Duk Op?</h2>\n"
" <p>\n"
" If you have come this far, you have hopefully been convinced of the need of "
"doing a small effort to protect your data and hide your traces on the "
"internet. The most normal situation, and probably also what you are "
"interested in here on Duk Op, is to avoid that your name, email or IP "
"address gets connected to a specific place, group of activists or type of "
"activity. Fortunately there is a good and easy-to-use tool that can help you "
"with it! Its name is TOR (The Onion Router), and can be downloaded here: <a "
"href=\"https://www.torproject.org\">www.torproject.org</a>\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>\n"
"  TOR is very simple to use: you unpack its compressed file, install it "
"(Ubuntu and Linux users: no install needed), and click on the icon. TOR then "
"launches a version of Mozilla Firefox, which is set up so that you can surf "
"anonymously on the internet. This means that no one can see which websites "
"you are visiting and, here on Duk Op, that no one can see that it is you, "
"that is creating a certain event. You can read more about TOR on their "
"homepage, but we can give you a couple of ideas on how you can use TOR on "
"Duk Op.\n"
" </p>\n"
" <p>You can use TOR on Duk Op in two different ways:</p>\n"
" <ol>\n"
"     <li>\n"
"          You can use it when you create anonmyous events (highly "
"recommended!). Only in this way you can be sure that there is no one else "
"reading the communication between your computer and our server, when you "
"create an event. In practice it means that you open TOR, write dukop.dk in "
"the address field of the TOR browser and create your anonymous events from "
"there.\n"
"     </li>\n"
"     <li>\n"
"          The other way to use TOR is to create a new email account, which "
"you can use to create a user on Duk Op. By creating a new email address and "
"by NEVER logging into it without using TOR, no one can see who the person "
"that sits behind the email address is. After you have created an email "
"address, you can use it to create a new Duk Op user. Afterwards, when you "
"log in to Duk Op via the TOR browser, you can make use of all the features "
"that registered users have access to, without compromising your internet "
"security.\n"
"     </li>\n"
" </ol>\n"
